Difference gyroscope accelerometer : 
A gyroscope is a device that uses Earth's gravity to help determine orientation. An accelerometer is a compact device designed to measure non-gravitational acceleration
The main difference between the two devices is simple: one can sense rotation, whereas the other cannot. When accelerating in a particular direction, the accelerometer is unable to distinguish between that and the acceleration provided through Earth's gravitational pull
